## September 3rd - Arrival

I arrived in Lisbon in the late afternoon, just in time to take in the city's atmosphere before the conference started. Since we hadn't registered for the pre-conference workshops, a colleague from our working group and I used the time to explore. Lisbon, one of Europe's oldest cities, has a long history as a major center of exploration and trade, shaped by its role in the Age of Discoveries. The city's mix of historic and modern influences is visible everywhere, from its iconic azulejo tiles to the winding streets of the old neighborhoods.

After walking through the Baixa and Rossio districts, we stopped at a small, traditional bar to try ginjinha, Lisbon's famous cherry liqueur. Traditionally served in a small glass, sometimes with a soaked cherry at the bottom, it has been a local specialty since the 19th century. The bar we visited, similar to the well-known A Ginjinha, had an old wooden counter and a simple setup, just bottles of ginja, glasses, and a choice of having it com ou sem (with or without a cherry). The drink was sweet, warming, and surprisingly strong. It was easy to see why it's been a favorite among locals for generations.

As the evening went on, we talked about the upcoming conference, going over the schedule and discussing which sessions we were most interested in. With the first day of NEOBIOTA 2024 ahead, we called it a night, ready to shift from Lisbon's historic streets to the latest research on biological invasions and excited for my first conference.

#### First morning of the conference

The first day of NEOBIOTA 2024 opened with a welcome ceremony, followed by the first keynote by Anthony Ricciardi, who posed the question: Do uncontrolled invasion rates threaten ecosystem sustainability? His talk challenged the idea that biological invasions are simply a localized issue, arguing instead that the continuous introduction of new species can lead to long-term destabilization of ecosystems. He introduced the concept of invasional meltdown, where accumulating invaders create self-reinforcing feedback loops, making ecosystems increasingly vulnerable to further invasions. Using case studies from freshwater and terrestrial systems, he showed that while only a small proportion of invaders cause major disruptions, their cumulative impact increases over time. One of the most compelling examples came from the Great Lakes, the world's most invaded freshwater ecosystem, where ballast water regulations have significantly reduced the rate of new introductions. This success, he argued, demonstrates that policy interventions can be effective, and even small reductions in invasion rates can have disproportionately large benefits for ecosystem stability.

<div class="col">
<p class="text-justify">Lisa Tedeschi presented her research on alien mammals that are threatened in their native range. This results in a paradox of species that are invasive in some areas while facing extinction in others. She analyzed 242 alien mammal species and identified 41 that are classified as threatened in their native ecosystems. Most of these species were introduced for hunting and are now widely distributed, with eastern Australia being a major hotspot for introduced populations. Her study examined how including alien populations in extinction risk assessments affects their conservation status. She found that for 22 percent of these species, their IUCN threat classification would be lower if their alien populations were taken into account. This raised the question of whether alien populations should be considered in conservation planning or if this would risk justifying biological invasions at the expense of native ecosystems. Some of these species face severe habitat loss or human pressure in their native range, while their introduced populations remain stable or even expand. In some cases, these alien populations could serve as a backup against extinction.</p>
</div>
</div>

However, Lisa also emphasized the ecological damage that many of these species cause in their non-native range. Invasive mammals have been linked to the decline of native species through competition, predation, and habitat alteration. Her talk sparked a discussion on how conservation and invasion science should approach species that exist at both ends of the spectrum.

By midday, our group took part in the first poster session. Fabio Mologni presented his research on the cumulative impacts of invasive plant species in riparian ecosystems of British Columbia, Canada. His work focused on developing a systematic protocol to assess how multiple invasive species interact within these sensitive habitats. While some invaders might amplify each other's effects, others could mitigate impacts, making it essential to study them in combination rather than in isolation. Using Russian olive (*Elaeagnus angustifolia*) and reed canarygrass (*Phalaris arundinacea*) as pilot species, he screened over 7,000 studies to identify patterns in research coverage, impact severity, and management responses. His findings highlighted significant research gaps, with some species extensively studied while others lacked impact assessments entirely. The protocol he developed could serve as a framework for prioritizing future research and management efforts.

Ekin Kaplan presented a global literature review on the trajectories of local vegetation change, synthesizing findings from nearly 5,000 re-survey studies conducted between 1834 and 2022. His review focused on changes in species richness and composition over time, revealing clear regional and habitat-specific trends. While species richness often remained stable in many studies, species composition changed significantly, reflecting shifts in dominant species and the increasing influence of non-native plants. His analysis showed that land-use change was the most frequently reported driver of vegetation shifts, followed by natural succession, climate change, and biological invasions. His work provides an overview of long-term biodiversity trends and identifies key knowledge gaps in global vegetation change research.

</div>
<div class="col">
<p class="text-justify">One of the more memorable talks in the afternoon came with Petr Pyšek's talk on plant invasions in the Kruger National Park. His presentation focused on how rivers serve as invasion corridors in South African savanna ecosystems, particularly for species like Xanthium strumarium, Datura innoxia, and Parthenium hysterophorus. These plants have rapidly spread along major river systems, raising concerns about their effects on vegetation, soil, and herbivores. What made this talk particularly engaging for me was the scale of his approach. He combined aerial mapping, high-resolution remote sensing, and long-term transect data to monitor the extent and dynamics of these invasions. The idea that biological invasions must be studied across multiple ecological levels resonated with me. I think we need more large-scale monitoring efforts to inform management decisions.</p>
<p>Núria Roura-Pascual gave the second keynote, shifting the focus to future management strategies for biological invasions in Europe. She took a scenario-based approach, analyzing different pathways for tackling invasions under varying levels of policy intervention, technological advancement, and public awareness. Her framework included 19 key goals, with four critical recommendations emerging as essential for long-term success: establishing a European biosecurity regime, improving communication strategies, standardizing data management, and developing a robust monitoring system. She stressed that proactive measures are necessary to manage biological invasions effectively. The talk provided a structured look at how invasion science must integrate across policy, society, and research to create sustainable long-term solutions.</p>
<p>Our first day come to a nice conclusion. Lisa's talk on threatened alien mammals not only challenged conventional views on extinction risk but also sparked thoughtful debate about the role of invasive populations in conservation. Fabio's work on collating evidence of cumulative impacts in riparian ecosystems provided a clear framework for understanding how multiple invaders interact in vulnerable habitats, while Ekin's comprehensive literature review on local vegetation change offered a global perspective on how species composition shifts over time despite stable species richness.</p>
<p>After a long day of conference sessions, we took some time to soak in the local Portuguese culture. I joined Lisa and Adrian for a final ginjinha at a charming bar in Lisbon, where we enjoyed lively conversation about the city's rich history and local specialties. It was a refreshing break from the academic rigor of the day, allowing us to appreciate the blend of science and culture that makes events like NEOBIOTA so memorable. Later in the evening, Ali, Adrián, Tom, and I went out for dinner at a local restaurant, enjoying good food and great Portuguese wine. The relaxed setting was a nice contrast to the fast-paced schedule of the conference, giving us time to unwind and talk about everything from research to travel plans. We left with a renewed sense of anticipation for Day 2.</p>

<div class="col">
<p class="text-justify">The second day started with a keynote by Elena Tricarico, who discussed how citizen science projects help involve local communities in tackling invasive species. She showed examples of how ordinary people significantly improved invasive species detection, and how this community involvement can lead to faster and better responses.</p>
<p>Following this, Anna Schertler from our group presented her research on alien fungal and fungus-like plant pathogens and their interactions with host plants. She explored how these pathogens form novel associations when introduced to new regions, often jumping to native or other alien plants. By combining large-scale datasets on plant and pathogen distributions, she analyzed the frequency of these biogeographically novel interactions, which can have significant ecological and agricultural consequences. Her findings showed that such associations are particularly common in species-rich regions, where a greater diversity of potential hosts increases the likelihood of new pathogen-host relationships. She also found that widely introduced pathogens with a broad host range are especially prone to forming new associations, making them more difficult to manage.</p>

<p class="text-justify"><i>Me (Gilles Colling) presenting my soon to be submitted work on alien species accumulation in agricultural fields</i></p>
</div>
<div class="col">
<p class="text-justify">During lunch, I presented my own poster, showcasing our research on the accumulation of alien plant species across Central European fields over the past ninety years. It was a nice opportunity to discuss my work with other researchers in an informal setting, receiving helpful feedback and suggestions.</p>
<p>Our study focused on tracking the accumulation of old (archaeophytes) and new (neophytes) alien plant species in arable fields across ten Central European countries from 1930 to 2019. Using an extensive dataset of 21,747 vegetation plots from the AgriWeedClim database, we applied generalized linear mixed-effect models to analyze species trends at different spatial scales. At the regional scale, we examined the percentage of plots containing neophytes to assess broad patterns of invasion, while at the local scale, we analyzed the proportion and relative abundance of alien species per plot, providing insights into their increasing dominance.</p>
<p>The results revealed a clear divergence between neophytes and archaeophytes over time. The percentage of plots containing neophytes increased dramatically, from 34.2% in 1930 to 70.1% in 2019, while their proportion in plots nearly doubled from 5.5% to 10.2%, and their relative abundance rose from 4.1% to 9.9%. This indicates that neophytes are not only spreading across the landscape but also gaining a stronger foothold within individual fields. In contrast, archaeophytes showed a much more stable pattern, with their proportion rising only slightly from 23.2% to 25.3%, and their relative abundance declining from 21.2% to 19.5% over the same period.</p>
<p>A sensitivity analysis revealed that this rise in neophyte dominance was primarily driven by a few widespread species, such as Veronica persica and Erigeron annuus, which were frequently recorded throughout the study period. These findings suggest that neophytes are increasingly shaping weed communities in agricultural landscapes, with the potential to drive long-term changes in plant community composition. As neophytes continue to expand across both regional and local scales, their growing prevalence could homogenize weed communities.</p>
</div>
</div>

During the poster session, Ali Omer from our group presented his work on the invasion risk of cultivated alien flora in Southern Africa under climate change. His study assessed how 1,527 alien plant species currently in cultivation might naturalize and spread in the future. Using species distribution models, he explored how climate change could alter the suitability of different biomes for these species. Unlike patterns observed in temperate regions, his findings suggest that rising temperatures and drier conditions may actually reduce invasion risks in most parts of Southern Africa, with only a few exceptions where certain alien species could still expand. However, already naturalized species remain a major concern, as they are likely to persist despite shifting climatic conditions. His poster sparked interesting discussions on how regional differences in climate responses shape invasion risks and what this means for management strategies in subtropical ecosystems.

#### Talks in the afternoon

In the afternoon, Franz Essl, the head of our group, gave a talk introducing a new perspective on the biogeography and macroecology of biological invasions in the Anthropocene. He discussed recent advances enabled by large-scale databases like GloNAF, which compiles detailed global data on alien plant distributions, and the Alien Species First Record database, which tracks spatiotemporal patterns of alien species introductions worldwide. By integrating these datasets with environmental and socio-economic variables, researchers can better understand why some regions experience more invasions than others and how invasion dynamics are shifting over time.

<p class="text-justify">Franz emphasized that biological invasions are fundamentally linked to human activity, with trade routes, human movement patterns, and land-use changes acting as major drivers.

While progress has been made in identifying hotspots of invasion, significant gaps remain in predicting future trends, particularly regarding how climate change will interact with invasion processes.</p>
<p>His talk also touched on the need for a more coordinated global approach to managing invasions, calling for improved biosecurity measures, better early warning systems, and stronger links between invasion biology and policy-making.</p>

The evening of September 5th ended with a cocktail reception and conference dinner at the Academy of Sciences in Lisbon, a historic venue at Rua da Academia das Ciências, 19. It was a good way to wind down after another full day of sessions, giving everyone a chance to talk in a more casual setting over Portuguese food and drinks. After dinner, some of us took a short walk through the city before calling it a night, ready for the final day of the conference.

## September 6th - Final Day of Conference

#### Morning

The last day of NEOBIOTA 2024 began with a keynote by Silvia Ziller, who spoke about the role of science in decision-making for invasive species policy and management. She highlighted the challenges of translating ecological research into actionable policies and the gaps that still exist between scientific recommendations and implementation. The talk provided insight into the complexities of policy-driven conservation and emphasized the need for stronger communication between scientists and decision-makers.

#### Afternoon

Later in the morning, Adrián García-Rodríguez from our group presented his work on the global environmental impacts of invasive alien chytrid fungi on amphibians. His research examined how the spread of chytrid fungi has contributed to amphibian population declines worldwide, identifying the ecological consequences of these invasions. The talk generated discussion on the challenges of managing fungal pathogens and the broader implications for amphibian conservation.

In the afternoon, Hanno Seebens gave a talk on the challenges of predicting which species will become the next invaders. He showed how invasion patterns might seem random at first but actually follow certain trends that can be modeled. He explained how factors like global shipping routes, trade networks, and environmental conditions shape the spread of alien species. While no perfect model exists yet, he argued that with better data integration and improved methods, we're getting closer to making reliable predictions. Since I plan to use the Alien Species First Records database in the future, his talk gave me plenty to think about.

The final keynote of the conference was delivered by Gregory Ruiz, who focused on how policy has influenced ship-mediated invasions in marine ecosystems. He examined whether regulations on ballast water and hull fouling have effectively reduced introductions of non-native species, providing an overview of long-term monitoring efforts and policy outcomes. His talk demonstrated the importance of sustained regulatory frameworks in controlling biological invasions and provided a useful comparison to other pathways of introduction.

At 18:00, the closing ceremony marked the official end of NEOBIOTA 2024. After three days of presentations, discussions, and networking, it was a moment to reflect on the broad range of research presented and the ongoing challenges in invasion ecology. The conference provided valuable exchanges of ideas, and the discussions will likely continue beyond Lisbon as we take what we learned back to our respective projects.

#### Evening

After the closing ceremony, we went out for a nice dinner with our group, enjoying a relaxed evening together after three days of intense discussions and presentations. Anna, Ali, Adrián, Ekin, Franz, Lisa, Tom, Fabio, and Adrián's wife joined as we found a spot to sit down, eat, and talk outside the conference setting. It was a good opportunity to reflect on the past few days, exchange final thoughts, and simply enjoy each other's company.

Later in the evening, Adrián took us to a typical South American salsa place, a lively venue filled with music, dancing, and a completely different energy from the conference halls. The atmosphere was vibrant, with locals and visitors dancing to Latin rhythms, and while some of us stayed at the bar, others joined in, picking up a few steps on the dance floor. It was a great way to end the trip, mixing Lisbon's international nightlife with a fun and unexpected experience before heading home.

## September 7th - Final Day in Lisbon

With the conference officially over, I had most of the day free before my evening departure. It was the perfect chance to explore more of Lisbon's rich history and culture, stepping away from the conference venue and immersing myself in the city's atmosphere.

<div class="row mb-lg-3">
<div class="col">
<p class="text-justify">During the conference, I learned about Lisbon's key role in Portugal's history of exploration and trade. As a center of maritime exploration during the Age of Discovery, Lisbon became a hub for goods, knowledge, and cultures from Europe, Africa, and the Americas. Its position along key trade routes made it not only an important center for commerce but also a place where scientific advancements, particularly in marine biology, took place. King Carlos I supported some of the earliest oceanographic studies in the country, leading deep-sea surveys that contributed to the understanding of marine ecosystems. Lisbon also saw the work of influential naturalists like Domingos Vandelli, who in the eighteenth century contributed to early ideas about species distribution. As this was my first conference, it left me with a lot to think about. It was interesting to see how different researchers approach similar questions in completely different ways. While some focused on large-scale patterns, others looked at highly specific case studies. The discussions about data, models, and conservation strategies highlighted just how complex invasion dynamics can be, but they also showed the value of collaborations.</p>

Spending the last day walking through Lisbon with colleagues from our institute gave me time to process everything. The mix of old and new seemed like a fitting backdrop after days of discussions and the challenges of doing research. It was a good way to end the trip before heading to the airport.
