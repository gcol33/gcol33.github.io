## Symposium Highlights

The VDSEE Symposium 2024, organized by the Vienna Doctoral School of Ecology and Evolution, took place on 16 February 2024 at the University of Vienna's Biology Building (Hörsaal 1). The event provided PhD candidates with the opportunity to present their research, connect with other researchers, and discuss ongoing projects in ecology and evolution.

The program featured two keynote lectures, oral presentations, and poster sessions. Gianluca Corno (CNR-IRSA, Italy) gave a keynote on antibiotic resistance from an ecological and evolutionary perspective, while Bianca Vienni-Baptista (ETH Zurich, Switzerland) discussed interdisciplinary research for sustainable futures. Participants presented their work across a range of topics, including microbial ecology, species interactions, and conservation strategies. The poster sessions, held in the foyer behind Hörsaal 1, provided a space for discussions with faculty and fellow researchers. The event concluded with an awards ceremony and a networking dinner.

<p>During this period, I started analyzing the AgriWeedClim database while working with it's curator Michael Glaser to resolve inconsistencies in sampling methods and regional variations. Using generalized linear mixed-effect models, I quantified trends in alien species accumulation, focusing on the percentage of plots containing neophytes and the proportional and relative abundance of both neophytes and archaeophytes over time. Later, I received targeted feedback on my manuscript from colleagues who provided taxonomic insights and ecological context, and my supervisors, Franz Essl and Stefan Dullinger, offered guidance on refining the study design and finalizing the manuscript.</p>
