Over the course of three days, participants engaged in more than 200 lectures and sessions covering risk assessment, management and control of invasive species, detection and monitoring tools, introduction pathways, and the environmental and socio-economic impacts of biological invasions. <br><br>Pre-conference workshops on September 3 focused on topics such as LIFE projects addressing biological invasions, assessment and management methods, economic utilization of invasive species, public policy development, and the role of citizen science. NeoBiota and Pensoft sponsored awards for Best Student Poster and Best Student Oral Presentation, with winners receiving free publications in the NeoBiota journal. <br><br>Our group had a strong presence at NEOBIOTA 2024, contributing to discussions on invasion ecology from multiple angles, ranging from global syntheses to regional case studies. With talks and posters covering invasive plant dynamics, alien mammal conservation, and the ecological impacts of biological invasions, our research sparked discussions throughout the conference. Lisa Tedeschi, Franz Essl, Adrian García-Rodriguez, Tom Vorstenbosch, Fabio Mologni, Anna Schertler, Ekin Kaplan, and I all participated, sharing our work and engaging with researchers from across the world. Beyond the scientific sessions, the conference also provided a great opportunity to explore Lisbon, enjoy the local food, and catch up outside of the formal setting.<br></p></div></div></div></div></div><!-- hero-img END --><!-- bloc-32 --><div class="bloc l-bloc" id="bloc-32"><div class="container bloc-lg bloc-no-padding-lg"><div class="row"><div class="col text-start"><h1 class="mb-4 text-lg-center mt-lg-4">September 3rd - Arrival</h1><div class="row"><div class="col"><p>I arrived in Lisbon in the late afternoon, just in time to take in the city's atmosphere before the conference started. Since we hadn’t registered for the pre-conference workshops, a colleague from our working group and I used the time to explore. Lisbon, one of Europe’s oldest cities, has a long history as a major center of exploration and trade, shaped by its role in the Age of Discoveries. The city's mix of historic and modern influences is visible everywhere, from its iconic azulejo tiles to the winding streets of the old neighborhoods.</p></div></div><div class="row mb-md-4 mb-sm-4 mb-4 mb-lg-3"><div class="col-12 col-lg-6"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="../img/lazyload-ph.png" data-srcset="../img/conference_neobiota2024_day1_1.webp"><img src="../img/lazyload-ph.png" data-src="../img/conference_neobiota2024_day1_1.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block img-rd-md lazyload" alt="conference_neobiota2024_day1_1" width="628" height="419"></picture></div><div class="col-lg-6"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="../img/lazyload-ph.png" data-srcset="../img/conference_neobiota2024_day1_2.webp"><img src="../img/lazyload-ph.png" data-src="../img/conference_neobiota2024_day1_2.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto none img-rd-md d-md-block  d-none lazyload" alt="conference_neobiota2024_day1_2" width="628" height="419"></picture></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col"><p>After walking through the Baixa and Rossio districts, we stopped at a small, traditional bar to try ginjinha, Lisbon’s famous cherry liqueur. Traditionally served in a small glass, sometimes with a soaked cherry at the bottom, it has been a local specialty since the 19th century. The bar we visited, similar to the well-known A Ginjinha, had an old wooden counter and a simple setup, just bottles of ginja, glasses, and a choice of having it com ou sem (with or without a cherry). The drink was sweet, warming, and surprisingly strong. It was easy to see why it’s been a favorite among locals for generations.<br><br>As the evening went on, we talked about the upcoming conference, going over the schedule and discussing which sessions we were most interested in.

His talk challenged the idea that biological invasions are simply a localized issue, arguing instead that the continuous introduction of new species can lead to long-term destabilization of ecosystems. He introduced the concept of invasional meltdown, where accumulating invaders create self-reinforcing feedback loops, making ecosystems increasingly vulnerable to further invasions. Using case studies from freshwater and terrestrial systems, he showed that while only a small proportion of invaders cause major disruptions, their cumulative impact increases over time. One of the most compelling examples came from the Great Lakes, the world’s most invaded freshwater ecosystem, where ballast water regulations have significantly reduced the rate of new introductions. This success, he argued, demonstrates that policy interventions can be effective, and even small reductions in invasion rates can have disproportionately large benefits for ecosystem stability.<br></p><div class="row pb-lg-3"><div class="col-lg-6"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="../img/lazyload-ph.png" data-srcset="../img/conference_neobiota2024_day2_lisa.webp"><img src="../img/lazyload-ph.png" data-src="../img/conference_neobiota2024_day2_lisa.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto img-rd-md lazyload" alt="conference_neobiota2024_day2_lisa" width="628" height="419"></picture><p class="text-justify"><i>Lisa Tedeschi presenting her work on threatened alien mammals</i></p></div><div class="col"><p class="text-justify">Lisa Tedeschi presented her research on alien mammals that are threatened in their native range. This results in a paradox of species that are invasive in some areas while facing extinction in others. She analyzed 242 alien mammal species and identified 41 that are classified as threatened in their native ecosystems. Most of these species were introduced for hunting and are now widely distributed, with eastern Australia being a major hotspot for introduced populations. Her study examined how including alien populations in extinction risk assessments affects their conservation status. She found that for 22 percent of these species, their IUCN threat classification would be lower if their alien populations were taken into account.&nbsp;This raised the question of whether alien populations should be considered in conservation planning or if this would risk justifying biological invasions at the expense of native ecosystems.&nbsp;Some of these species face severe habitat loss or human pressure in their native range, while their introduced populations remain stable or even expand. In some cases, these alien populations could serve as a backup against extinction.</p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col"><p>However, Lisa also emphasized the ecological damage that many of these species cause in their non-native range. Invasive mammals have been linked to the decline of native species through competition, predation, and habitat alteration.

Fabio Mologni presented his research on the cumulative impacts of invasive plant species in riparian ecosystems of British Columbia, Canada. His work focused on developing a systematic protocol to assess how multiple invasive species interact within these sensitive habitats. While some invaders might amplify each other’s effects, others could mitigate impacts, making it essential to study them in combination rather than in isolation. Using Russian olive (<i>Elaeagnus angustifolia</i>) and reed canarygrass (<i>Phalaris arundinacea</i>) as pilot species, he screened over 7,000 studies to identify patterns in research coverage, impact severity, and management responses. His findings highlighted significant research gaps, with some species extensively studied while others lacked impact assessments entirely.

His review focused on changes in species richness and composition over time, revealing clear regional and habitat-specific trends. While species richness often remained stable in many studies, species composition changed significantly, reflecting shifts in dominant species and the increasing influence of non-native plants. His analysis showed that land-use change was the most frequently reported driver of vegetation shifts, followed by natural succession, climate change, and biological invasions. His work provides an overview of long-term biodiversity trends and identifies key knowledge gaps in global vegetation change research.<br></p><h4 class="mb-4 mb-lg-2">Afternoon & Evening</h4><div class="row"><div class="col"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12 col-lg-6 pb-lg-3 pb-3"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="../img/lazyload-ph.png" data-srcset="../img/conference_neobiota2024_day2_final.webp"><img src="../img/lazyload-ph.png" data-src="../img/conference_neobiota2024_day2_final.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block img-rd-md lazyload" alt="conference_neobiota2024_day2_final" width="628" height="837"></picture><p class="text-justify"><i>Enjoying a ginjinha with&nbsp;</i>Adrián<i>&nbsp;and Lisa,&nbsp;</i><i>first introduced by monks in the 17th century, now a staple of Lisbon’s bar culture, served straight or with a soaked cherry at historic taverns</i></p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="../img/lazyload-ph.png" data-srcset="../img/conference_neobiota2024_day2_dinner.webp"><img src="../img/lazyload-ph.png" data-src="../img/conference_neobiota2024_day2_dinner.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block img-rd-md lazyload" alt="conference_neobiota2024_day2_dinner" width="628" height="419"></picture><p class="text-justify"><i>Dinner with Ali, Adrián, and Tom at a local Lisbon restaurant</i></p></div><div class="col"><p class="text-justify">One of the more memorable talks in the afternoon came with Petr Pyšek’s talk on plant invasions in the Kruger National Park. His presentation focused on how rivers serve as invasion corridors in South African savanna ecosystems, particularly for species like Xanthium strumarium, Datura innoxia, and Parthenium hysterophorus. These plants have rapidly spread along major river systems, raising concerns about their effects on vegetation, soil, and herbivores. What made this talk particularly engaging for me was the scale of his approach. He combined aerial mapping, high-resolution remote sensing, and long-term transect data to monitor the extent and dynamics of these invasions. The idea that biological invasions must be studied across multiple ecological levels resonated wtih me. I think we need more large-scale monitoring efforts to inform management decisions.<br><br>Núria Roura-Pascual gave the second keynote, shifting the focus to future management strategies for biological invasions in Europe. She took a scenario-based approach, analyzing different pathways for tackling invasions under varying levels of policy intervention, technological advancement, and public awareness. Her framework included 19 key goals, with four critical recommendations emerging as essential for long-term success: establishing a European biosecurity regime, improving communication strategies, standardizing data management, and developing a robust monitoring system. She stressed that proactive measures are necessary to manage biological invasions effectively. The talk provided a structured look at how invasion science must integrate across policy, society, and research to create sustainable long-term solutions.<br><br>Our first day come to a nice conclusion. Lisa’s talk on threatened alien mammals not only challenged conventional views on extinction risk but also sparked thoughtful debate about the role of invasive populations in conservation. Fabio’s work on collating evidence of cumulative impacts in riparian ecosystems provided a clear framework for understanding how multiple invaders interact in vulnerable habitats, while Ekin’s comprehensive literature review on local vegetation change offered a global perspective on how species composition shifts over time despite stable species richness. <br><br>After a long day of conference sessions, we took some time to soak in the local Portuguese culture. I joined Lisa and Adrian for a final ginjinha at a charming bar in Lisbon, where we enjoyed lively conversation about the city’s rich history and local specialties. It was a refreshing break from the academic rigor of the day, allowing us to appreciate the blend of science and culture that makes events like NEOBIOTA so memorable. Later in the evening, Ali, Adrián, Tom, and I went out for dinner at a local restaurant, enjoying good food and great Portuguese wine. The relaxed setting was a nice contrast to the fast-paced schedule of the conference, giving us time to unwind and talk about everything from research to travel plans.

It was a nice opportunity to discuss my work with other researchers in an informal setting, receiving helpful feedback and suggestions.<br><br>Our study focused on tracking the accumulation of old (archaeophytes) and new (neophytes) alien plant species in arable fields across ten Central European countries from 1930 to 2019. Using an extensive dataset of 21,747 vegetation plots from the AgriWeedClim database, we applied generalized linear mixed-effect models to analyze species trends at different spatial scales. At the regional scale, we examined the percentage of plots containing neophytes to assess broad patterns of invasion, while at the local scale, we analyzed the proportion and relative abundance of alien species per plot, providing insights into their increasing dominance.<br><br>The results revealed a clear divergence between neophytes and archaeophytes over time. The percentage of plots containing neophytes increased dramatically, from 34.2% in 1930 to 70.1% in 2019, while their proportion in plots nearly doubled from 5.5% to 10.2%, and their relative abundance rose from 4.1% to 9.9%. This indicates that neophytes are not only spreading across the landscape but also gaining a stronger foothold within individual fields. In contrast, archaeophytes showed a much more stable pattern, with their proportion rising only slightly from 23.2% to 25.3%, and their relative abundance declining from 21.2% to 19.5% over the same period.<br><br>A sensitivity analysis revealed that this rise in neophyte dominance was primarily driven by a few widespread species, such as Veronica persica and Erigeron annuus, which were frequently recorded throughout the study period. These findings suggest that neophytes are increasingly shaping weed communities in agricultural landscapes, with the potential to drive long-term changes in plant community composition. As neophytes continue to expand across both regional and local scales, their growing prevalence could homogenize weed communities.<br></p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col"><p>During the poster session, Ali Omer from our group presented his work on the invasion risk of cultivated alien flora in Southern Africa under climate change. His study assessed how 1,527 alien plant species currently in cultivation might naturalize and spread in the future. Using species distribution models, he explored how climate change could alter the suitability of different biomes for these species. Unlike patterns observed in temperate regions, his findings suggest that rising temperatures and drier conditions may actually reduce invasion risks in most parts of Southern Africa, with only a few exceptions where certain alien species could still expand. However, already naturalized species remain a major concern, as they are likely to persist despite shifting climatic conditions. His poster sparked interesting discussions on how regional differences in climate responses shape invasion risks and what this means for management strategies in subtropical ecosystems.</p><h4 class="mb-4 mb-lg-2">Talks in the afternoon</h4><p>In the afternoon, Franz Essl, the head of our group, gave a talk introducing a new perspective on the biogeography and macroecology of biological invasions in the Anthropocene.

As a center of maritime exploration during the Age of Discovery, Lisbon became a center for goods, knowledge, and cultures from Europe, Africa, and the Americas. Its position along key trade routes made it not only an important hub for commerce but also a place where scientific advancements and in particular in marine biology, took place. King Carlos I supported some of the earliest oceanographic studies in the country, leading deep-sea surveys that contributed to the understanding of marine ecosystems. Lisbon also saw the work of influential naturalists like Domingos Vandelli, who in the eighteenth century contributed to early ideas about species distribution.&nbsp;As this was my first conference, it left me with a lot to think about. It was interesting to see how different researchers approach similar questions in completely different ways. While some focused on large-scale patterns, others looked at highly specific case studies.
